 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link
 * BrowserAnimationsModule BrowserAnimationsModule} or {\@link NoopAnimationsModule
 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link
 * style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link
 * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).
 *
 * ```typescript

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist of

 * provided styling data immediately while a call to `animate()` will apply its styling data over a
 * given time depending on its timing data.

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 * ```
 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once

 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))

 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

/**

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ])
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```

/**
 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * `query` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's

 *
 * query() is used to find one or more inner elements within the current element that is
 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query
 * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo
 *
 * ```
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *    trigger('queryAnimation', [
 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]
 * })
 * class Cmp {
 *   exp = '';

 *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';

/**
 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * Component to display an icon. It can be used in the following ways:
 * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL. The SVG content is directly inlined
 *   as a child of the <md-icon> component, so that CSS styles can easily be applied to it.
 *   The URL is loaded via an XMLHttpRequest, so it must be on the same domain as the page or its
 *   server must be configured to allow cross-domain requests.
 *   Example:
 *     <md-icon svgSrc="assets/arrow.svg"></md-icon>
 *
 * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the
 *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of
 *   MdIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format
 *   "[namespace]:[name]", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.
 *   Examples:
 *     <md-icon svgIcon="left-arrow"></md-icon>
 *     <md-icon svgIcon="animals:cat"></md-icon>
 *
 * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>
 *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at
 *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an
 *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the
 *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.
 *   Examples:
 *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>
 *     <md-icon fontSet="myfont">sun</md-icon>
 *
 * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the
 *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a
 *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in
 *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/
 *   Example:
 *     <md-icon fontSet="fa" fontIcon="alarm"></md-icon>

/**
 * Recognizer flow explained; *
 * All recognizers have the initial state of POSSIBLE when a input session starts.
 * The definition of a input session is from the first input until the last input, with all it's movement in it. *
 * Example session for mouse-input: mousedown -> mousemove -> mouseup
 *
 * On each recognizing cycle (see Manager.recognize) the .recognize() method is executed
 * which determines with state it should be.
 *
 * If the recognizer has the state FAILED, CANCELLED or RECOGNIZED (equals ENDED), it is reset to
 * POSSIBLE to give it another change on the next cycle.
