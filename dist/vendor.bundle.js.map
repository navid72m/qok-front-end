If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\\@link trigger\n * trigger} function.\n *\n * #### The `void` state\n *\n * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not\n * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the\n * associated element is void).\n *\n * #### The `*` (default) state\n *\n * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being\n * animated is not declared within the trigger.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles\n * within the given trigger.\n *\n * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.\n * - `styles` refers to the {\\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once\n * the state has been reached.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // \"void\" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent\n * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.\n * state(\"void\", style({ height: 0 }))\n *\n * // user-defined states\n * state(\"closed\", style({ height: 0 }))\n * state(\"open, visible\", style({ height: \"*\" }))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} styles\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction state(name, styles, options) {\n    return { type: 0 /* State */, name: name, styles: styles, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `keyframes` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs.

For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become.

This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence. Reusable animations are designed to make use of\n * animation parameters and the produced animation can be used via the `useAnimation` method.\n *\n * ```\n * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n *   animate('{{ time }}',\n *     style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n * ], { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n * ```\n *\n * If parameters are attached to an animation then they act as **default parameter values**.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animateChild(options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 9 /* AnimateChild */, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

It can be used in the following ways:\n * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL. The SVG content is directly inlined\n *   as a child of the <md-icon> component, so that CSS styles can easily be applied to it.\n *   The URL is loaded via an XMLHttpRequest, so it must be on the same domain as the page or its\n *   server must be configured to allow cross-domain requests.\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon svgSrc=\"assets/arrow.svg\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the\n *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of\n *   MdIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _mdIconRegistry\n     */\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /**\n         * Color of the icon.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newColor\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} color\n     * @param {?} isAdd\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
